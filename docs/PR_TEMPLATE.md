# Pull Request: Implement direct FieldRoutes API to Snowflake pipeline

## Summary
âœ… **TESTED AND WORKING** - Successfully loaded customer data from office 1 directly into Snowflake!

- Removes Azure Blob Storage intermediary step for a simpler, more reliable data flow
- Implements direct loading from FieldRoutes API to Snowflake tables
- Improves performance with bulk inserts and optimized JSON serialization

## Changes
- **New Files**: Created Snowflake-direct versions of ETL and CDC flows
- **Dependencies**: Removed Azure packages, added `orjson` for fast JSON handling (with fallback)
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive test script (`test_direct_minimal.py`)
- **Documentation**: Created migration guide with detailed instructions
- **Backwards Compatibility**: New files created alongside existing ones for safe rollout

## Benefits
1. **Simplified Pipeline**: Eliminates intermediate storage step
2. **Better Error Handling**: Failed chunks don't block other data
3. **Improved Performance**: Bulk inserts with efficient JSON serialization
4. **Easier Debugging**: Direct pipeline is easier to troubleshoot

## Test Results
âœ… Successfully tested with office 1 customer entity:
- Made only 2 API calls (well within 20.5K daily limit)
- Retrieved customer data from last 7 days
- Successfully inserted data into `RAW.fieldroutes.Customer_Dim`
- Test data saved to `office_1_customer_testresult.csv`

## Files Changed
### New Files
- `flows/fieldroutes_etl_flow_snowflake.py` - Main ETL flow with direct Snowflake loading
- `flows/fieldroutes_cdc_flow_snowflake.py` - CDC flow for high-velocity entities
- `flows/deploy_flows_snowflake.py` - Deployment script
- `test_direct_minimal.py` - Minimal test script (2 API calls only)
- `test_snowflake_direct.py` - Comprehensive test script
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed migration instructions
- `TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Testing guide
- `run_test.bat` - Windows batch file for easy testing

### Modified Files
- `requirements.txt` - Removed Azure dependencies, added orjson

## Test Plan
- [x] Run `python test_direct_minimal.py` to test single entity
- [ ] Run `python test_snowflake_direct.py --full` to test multiple entities
- [ ] Deploy flows with `python -m flows.deploy_flows_snowflake`
- [ ] Run manual deployment test
- [ ] Monitor for any API rate limit issues

## Migration Steps
1. Install updated dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Test with minimal script: `python test_direct_minimal.py`
3. Deploy new flows: `python -m flows.deploy_flows_snowflake`
4. Monitor initial runs before disabling old flows

## API Usage Considerations
- Minimal test used only 2 API calls
- Full deployment includes pauses between offices to respect rate limits
- Chunk size of 1,000 records per API call
- CDC runs limited to high-velocity entities during business hours

## Next Steps After Merge
1. Deploy to production Prefect instance
2. Run initial load for all offices (monitor API usage)
3. Schedule regular runs (nightly + CDC)
4. Disable old Azure-based flows after confirming stability
